# _PactSwift_ Core Contributor Expectations

We are always looking for active, enthusiastic members of the developer community to become core contributors.

We hope to harness the diversity of the iOS/macOS Developer community to build the _PactSwift_ into an essential tool for developers.

## How does one become a Core Contributor?

Contributors who have displayed lasting commitment to the evolution and maintenance of this project will be invited to become Core Contributors. For instance, contributors who:

- Love to help out other users with issues on GitHub
- Continue to make _PactSwift_ a stable product and encourage features aligned with our [vision][vision].

## Core Contributors

- Review pull requests using the "Review Changes" feature in GitHub.
- Merge pull requests we review, except for PRs where the author has push access.
- Respond to issues and help others.
- Own regressions caused by our own contributions and PR approvals.
- Maintain consistent coding standards.
- Inform other Core Contributors when critical fixes are merged so a release can be prepared.
- Identify other community members who would be effective Core Contributors.
- Ensure that new contributions fit into the [Vision][vision].
- Adhere to the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
- Keep external dependencies to a minimum.
- Keep test coverage high and ensure up-to-date documentation.
- Are polite, friendly and having fun contributing.

## Pull Request Ownership

We work in a high-trust environment which implies that anyone and everyone is able to merge pull requests from the community. If the PR reviewer feels strongly about seeing a PR to completion, they should assign it to themselves and request necessary changes.

## Adding Dependencies

We want to keep _PactSwift_ focused and robust. Avoid adding new dependencies to the code base unless absolutely necessary.
