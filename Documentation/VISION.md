# Our Vision

_PactSwift_ automates the process of generating Pact contracts.

_PactSwift_ provides a simple and easy to use framework in one's Swift or Objective-C project that creates workflows where Pact contracts are generated.

_PactSwift_ will continue to evolve, in a measured way that extends its functionality to make it an indespensable tool for developers writing [Consumer Driven contracts][consumer-driven-contracts].
